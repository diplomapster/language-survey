      <button id="submit" class="btn btn-primary">What is my Language!</button>

      <div id="c">
        <h2>Your language is C#!</h2>
        <p><span class="name"></span>, you are old and stodgy, a crusty member of the elite, set in your ways and used to having power and privilege. <strong>That makes C# the perfect language for you!</strong> Around since practically the dark ages it is the language favored by the established and entrenched plutocracies of the world.  </P>

        <p>According to the founder of epicodus <em>Michael Kaiser-Nyman</em>, "C# is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. C# has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for a larger company on business software, C# is a great choice."

      <div id="java">
        <h2>Your language is Java!</h2>
        <p><span class="name"></span>, like a cup of coffee in the morning from that place on the corner, you exist, and you get the job done. <strong>That makes java the perfect language for you!</strong> The language has been around for a while and has been used during that time.  </p>

        <p>According to the founder of epicodus <em>Michael Kaiser-Nyman</em>, "Java is also a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal is broader as well: it's one of the most popular of all programming languages, and it's used in everything from for high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces. Because Java has been very popular for a very long time and is used in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand language. If you're interested in working for an enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance applications, Java could be a good language to learn."

      <div id="ruby">
        <h2>Your language is Ruby!</h2>
        <p><span class="name"></span>, you are new, you are hip, you are rebellious. <strong>That makes ruby the perfect language for you!</strong> This sporty new language is always looking to meet new people and is found in the coolest bars and nightclubs from san Francisco to Sao Paulo.</p>

        <p>According to the founder of epicodus <em>Michael Kaiser-Nyman</em>, "Ruby is a favorite language of developers building interactive web applications. If an app involves users creating accounts, entering information, and interacting with dynamic content, there's a good chance it is built with Ruby. Ruby became popular because the Rails framework, which is written with Ruby, simplified many of the common tasks associated with building web applications. It's most popular with startups and smaller companies who are looking to build their product quickly."
